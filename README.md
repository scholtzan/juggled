## Required Materials

The following components are required to build a single juggling ball:

* ESP32  DEVKIT V1
	* This development board has an onboard Bluetooth module, will control the LEDs and collect data from the accelerometer
* Lithium  Battery  3.7V
	* The battery will power the ESP32 and all other components
* Li-lon Battery  Charger
	* This component will ensure that the Lithium battery can be recharged via micro USB
* Accelerometer
	* For collecting data on whether the juggling ball has been thrown or caught
* 2x RGB LEDs
	* To make the juggling ball glow
* Resistors
	* 1x 1kΩ
	* 1x 4.7kΩ
	* Used to read the battery charge via the ESP32
* Switch
	* To turn the juggling ball on and off
* Wire
	* For connecting all the components
* Heat Shrink Tubes
	* For insulating soldered wires
* Soldering Iron + Solder
	* All the components need to be soldered together
* Transparent TPU
	* For printing the outer shell
	* Soft and flexible material will ensure that components and inner core are protected when juggling balls are dropped
* Clear PLA+
	* For inner core that will help to keep electronics in place
